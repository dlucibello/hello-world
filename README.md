A place to put data and supporting documents from my research project called, "Space Race, Siri and the Central Dogma: A Contemporary Nursing Analysis of Antibiotics Resistance."  This was a NU499 senior thesis at Carroll College across fall 18/spring   19 semesters.  
Enclosed in this branch are: 
1. copy of my IRB exemption for the research
2. Compiled spreadsheets with the data endorsement responses collected into .csv files
3. Original R code for these data analyses.
